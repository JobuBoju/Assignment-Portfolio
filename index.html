    It required rudimentary capabilities of using HTML and CSS along with showcasing archaic understandings of how to use GitHub and GitHub Pages.</div>

    <div class = "cell1">Hello World for the Web</div>
    <div class = "cell2">This is the simpler version of the Getting to Know Each Other website and was made first. It utilized a template given by Eric Pogue, my professor,
    and served as a sort of "Hello World for the Web" in the sense that it was my first website I've ever made by myself. It required archaic understandings of HTML and CSS and
    showcased that I could follow a tutorial on how to use GitHub and GitHub Pages.</div>

    <div class = "cell1">Assignment Portfolio</div>
    <div class = "cell2">This assignment's purpose is to archive all assignments done for my Software Engineering course and you are currently looking at it. There were
      not many requirements for this assignment so I decided to keep it as simple as possible. It requires a rudimentary understaning of HTML and CSS and showcases rudimentary 
      understanding of GitHub and Microsoft Azure.
