    <div class = "cell1">Getting to Know Each Other</div>
    <div class = "cell2">This assignment had me create a basic website using Github and GitHub Pages which introduced myself thoroughly to my classmates.
    It required rudimentary capabilities of using HTML and CSS along with showcasing archaic understandings of how to use GitHub and GitHub Pages.</div>

    <div class = "cell1">Hello World for the Web</div>
    <div class = "cell2">This is the simpler version of the Getting to Know Each Other website and was made first. It utilized a template given by Eric Pogue, my professor,
    and served as a sort of "Hello World for the Web" in the sense that it was my first website I've ever made by myself. It required archaic understandings of HTML and CSS and
    showcased that I could follow a tutorial on how to use GitHub and GitHub Pages.</div>

    <div class = "cell1">Assignment Portfolio</div>
    <div class = "cell2">This assignment's purpose is to archive all assignments done for my Software Engineering course and you are currently looking at it. There were
      not many requirements for this assignment so I decided to keep it as simple as possible. It requires a rudimentary understaning of HTML and CSS and showcases rudimentary 
      understanding of GitHub and Microsoft Azure.

    <div class = "cell1">Azure Website</div>
    <div class = "cell2">This assignment is similar to the Hello World for the Web assignment as it is essentially a "Hello World for Microsoft Azure". This assignment's purpose
      was just to show that I could deploy a very simple website hosted in Microsoft Azure and as such has the same requirements of Hello World for the Web along with an archaic
      understanding of Microsoft Azure. This assignment was also done before the Assignment Portfolio.

    <div class = "cell1">Web Resume</div>
    <div class = "cell2">This assignment had me recreate the example resume of someone who graduated from Lewis University with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.
      This was the hardest assignment so far but also the most fun. I definitely learned the most from this assignment as I had to get more familiar with HTML and CSS 
      so that I could properly mimic the website. I would say that I now have a beginners understanding of HTML and CSS and of course through continous use of 
      Github and Microsoft Azure I would say I have also reached a beginners understanding in that as well. </div>

    <div class = "cell1">Web Dice Roller</div>
    <div class = "cell2">This assignment had me mimic the dice rolling aspect of the board game Yahtzee. This also marks the first time I've implemeneted JS into a website.
      I wanted to do the logic by myself but as I had to implement something that I didn't know how to in the HTML I had to consult ChatGPT and like always using the code from the LLM
      crashed my script. So I ended up scrapping my originality and put my script into ChatGPT asking it to fix it and it did. The assignment was super basic though compared to the 
      web resume as I just had to write the instructions, create 5 boxes side by side to represent the dice, and create a button that when pressed would generate a number inside of 
      the boxes. I would say I now have an archaic understanding of JS.
